These scripts were hacked together to provide support for using the Qwen3 Text Embedder model to produce text embeddings for inference with the Chroma image generation model, and for distillation training Qwen3 using T5-xxl as the teacher in order to produce text embeddings that more closely match those of the T5-xxl model.

WARNING: don't expect this to work at the moment.
